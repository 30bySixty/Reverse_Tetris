We've all played Tetris - a game where we're tasked with optimally placing various blocks. I thought it'd be fun to see if I could code the logic we simple humans use to plays Tetris. 

When you download and run this app, you'll be faced with a set of blocks and a game grid. Click on the blocks, and watch my program place the blocks on the grid! See if you can make my program lose!

P.S. I wrote this game in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS because, why not?
